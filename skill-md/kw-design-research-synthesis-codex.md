**Date:** [Date range] | **Researcher:** [Name]

### Executive Summary
[3-4 sentence overview of key findings]

### Key Themes

#### Theme 1: [Name]
**Prevalence:** [X of Y participants]
**Summary:** [What this theme is about]
**Supporting Evidence:**
- "[Quote]" — P[X]
- "[Quote]" — P[X]
**Implication:** [What this means for the product]

#### Theme 2: [Name]
[Same format]

### Insights → Opportunities

| Segment | Characteristics | Needs | Size |
|---------|----------------|-------|------|
| [Name] | [Description] | [Key needs] | [Rough %] |

### Recommendations

2. **[Medium priority]** — [Why]
3. **[Lower priority]** — [Why]

### Questions for Further Research
- [What we still don't know]

### Methodology Notes
[How the research was conducted, any limitations or biases to note]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~user feedback** is connected:
- Pull support tickets, feature requests, and NPS responses to supplement research data
- Cross-reference themes with real user complaints and requests

If **~~product analytics** is connected:
- Validate qualitative findings with usage data and behavioral metrics
- Quantify the impact of identified pain points

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for prior research studies and findings to compare against
- Publish the synthesis to your research repository

## Tips

1. **Include raw quotes** — Direct participant quotes make insights credible and memorable.
2. **Separate observations from interpretations** — "5 of 8 users clicked the wrong button" is an observation. "The button placement is confusing" is an interpretation.
3. **Quantify where possible** — "Most users" is vague. "7 of 10 users" is specific.
