If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Pull project status, completed items, and upcoming milestones automatically
- Identify at-risk items and overdue tasks

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Scan recent team discussions for decisions and blockers to include
- Offer to post the finished report to a channel

## Tips

1. **Lead with the headline** — Busy leaders read the first 3 lines. Make them count.

3. **Make decisions easy** — For each decision needed, provide context and a recommendation.
